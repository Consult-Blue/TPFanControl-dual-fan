# TPFanControl for dual-fan ThinkPads (P1, X1 Extreme..)

Tested on a ThinkPad P1 Gen 3 with Nvidia GPU.

## About

This is a fork of https://github.com/byrnes/TPFanControl. On my machine, the fan on the right side is not always stopped and this fork aims to fix this issue.

## Requirements

As a requirement either install [tvicport](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/dev/port/index.shtm) manually or install the original version of TPFanControl found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tp4xfancontrol/), and run the dual-fan version instead of the original version.

## Running at startup

Currently not possible with Windows 10 because it lacks a certificate to prevent the Windows security warning.
